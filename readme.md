#VBA Challenge

<<<<<<< HEAD
#Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
##The purpose of the analysis is to find the daily volume of a stock throughout a given year and the rate of return on that stock.  The VBA code we created calculates the analysis and provides an easy to read summary.

#Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##The analysis proved to be the same for both versions of the code.  The refactored code ran faster than the original VBA code.

#Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
#What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
##The advantages is that it is able to process the data quicker.  The disadvantage is that it can be confusing to swap out the code.

#How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
##The original script, to me, felt more direct.  The refactored version took a long time to get correct.  I had to do a lot of work to get the coding to work properly.
